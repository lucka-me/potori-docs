# Manage Data

## Nominations

### Import and Export
If you have saved data files (Nomination data file and Brainstorming data file) locally, you can open it to review your nominations without login.

If you have uploaded data files before, Potori will try to download them from your Google Drive after login.

You can save the nomination data to your computer by clicking the *Save File* from menu, files named `Potori.json` and `bsdata.json` will be downloaded.

The nomination data will **NOT** be uploaded to your Google Drive automatically. If you have login, you can upload the data by clicking the *Upload File* from menu.

### Import from Wayfarer JSON
Potori can parse data from [Wayfarer API](https://wayfarer.nianticlabs.com/api/v1/vault/manage "Wayfarer API") and update the title and location of nominations. Click *Import* from menu to open the *Import Dialog*, paste the JSON code from Wayfarer API and click Import.
