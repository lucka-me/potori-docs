# Auth
Potori will obtain your mails related to Portal nominations from your Gmail inbox, so you must login with your Google account to use it.

## Permissions
Potori requires the following permissions:

### Gmail: Read Only
***REQUIRED***

This is the core permission on which Potori is dependent. Potori will obtain mails related to Ingress Portal nomination, then extract and display informations from them.

The mail IDs will be saved in data file if you save the data file in your computer or your Google Drive. Except that, all of your mail data will stay in your browser page.

### Google Drive: File
***RECOMMENDED***

Potori could upload your nomination data and Brainstorming data to your Google Drive manually, and download the data before fetching your mails.

With the data files, Potori will not obtain and process all mails every time, which could reduce the network traffic and time usage.

The file will be storaged in a private app folder where only Potori can access.
