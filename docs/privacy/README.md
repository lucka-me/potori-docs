# Privacy
Briefly, Potori would not collect any of your data. All of your data will be handled inside your browser, and deleted when you close the page. You can save your data in your own Google Drive (where only Potori can access) or locally, they are totally under your control.

We are trying to protect your privacy with my knowledge, if you have any suggestion, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/lucka-me/potori/issues) or [contact us](../contribute#Contributors).

## Data Usage
Potori will use following data of yours:

- Mails related to Portal nomination  
  Potori will only obtain and analyze confirmation, acceptance and rejection mails.
- Content of the mails
  - Mail ID  
    If you save or upload the data file, mail id will be used to avoid obtaining and processing the same mail every time.
  - Subject  
    Extract title of Wayspot.
  - Timestamp  
    Regarded as the confirmation / acceptance / rejection time of the nomination.
  - Photo URL  
    Show photo in the card.  
    Generate a short UID as the ID of Portal and identify them in mails.  
    The short UID will be used to query Brainstorming data and generate link to Brainstorming watermeter.
  - Intel Map URL  
    Extract the coordinate and display a marker on the map.
  - Mail Body  
    Extract the rejection reason.

## About the Data File
To reduce the network traffic and time useage, Potori provides a feature which allows you to save the data files and upload them to a private app folder in your own Google Drive where only Potori could access. The data contained in the file are described above.
